    let age2 = age;
    console.log("\n------------------------------------\n", age, age2);

    let name = "Me";
    let name2 = name;
    console.log("\n------------------------------------\n", name, name2);
    name = "Two Me's!";
    console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const people = ['Me', 'Anonymous', 'No-name', 'Someone else'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = people;

    console.log("\n------------------------------------\n", people, team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Person';
    console.log("\n------------------------------------\n", team, people);

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = people.slice();
    console.log(team2);
    team2[3] = 'Person';
    console.log("\n------------------------------------\n", team2, team, people);

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(people);
    console.log("\n------------------------------------\n", team3, team2, team, people);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...people];
    console.log("\n------------------------------------\n", team4, team3, team2, team, people);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Me Mylastname',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
